A voting method satisfies monotonicity criterion if a winning candidate receives more votes, then he must still be the winner of the election. For example, changing our vote in a way to signify a stronger preference for candidate A should not decrease the chance of A to win the election. In other word, more votes are better or at least as good. This Criterion is very important since the method that violates this criterion will cause conflict among the voters. Wright states that most of the methods introduced in this study satisfy monotonicity criterion. The voting methods that violate this criterion are alternative vote, instant runoff worst defeat, and instant runoff borda count. #Monotonicity
